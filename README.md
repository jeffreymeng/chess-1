# Chess AI
A very simple chess AI using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

Check it out here: http://www.mvai.club/chess/

## Instructions
All relevant code is in `index.js`, `index.html`, and `index.css`.

The `css/`, `img/`, and `js/` folders contains library code.

If you are a pro coder and want a challenge, go to the `for-pro-coders` folder.

If you are a beginner, use the folders beginning with `step-`.  
In each of those folders, there is a `start` and `end` folder. Modify `step-{num}/start/index.js`, and if you get stuck, refer to `step-{num}/end/index.js` for the solution.

The final project can be viewed at `index.html`.
